This repo serves as a reference for the OHDSI reproducibility challenge, which aimed to reproduce the populations (exposures and outcomes) used in the analysis by Albogami et al. The study resulted from the workshop aimed to quantify the heterogeneity of interpretations that qualified researchers may produce when attempting to reproduce the same study.
